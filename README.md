# YouTube Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a YouTube dataset using Python. The goal is to understand trends, patterns, and key insights related to YouTube video performance through structured analysis and visualization.

## Objectives

* Explore and clean the YouTube dataset
* Analyze key metrics such as views, likes, comments, and engagement
* Identify patterns and trends using visualizations
* Derive meaningful insights from the data

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn (if applicable)
